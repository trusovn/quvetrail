## Skill installation resolution

This block is managed by the `personal-skills` development-profile installer.
Rerun the installer to update it; keep repository-specific instructions outside
these markers.

- When work in the current repository uses a named skill and a matching project-local copy exists under `.agents/skills/`, resolve and read that project-local copy before considering user-global skill paths. Do not probe or switch to a user-global copy after a matching project-local skill has been selected for the invocation.
- Resolve shared tooling from the same installation root as the active skill. For a project-local `.agents/skills/` installation, use only the sibling `.agents/scripts/`; do not mix project-local skills with user-global helpers or vice versa.
- If optional shared tooling is missing or unavailable, follow the active skill's documented fallback behavior. Do not silently replace it with tooling from another installation root.
